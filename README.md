# My fist Java Project 

This was my first Java game made in Processing 4.3
I made this game in school for "Tag der offenen Tür" a day where pupils from other schools visit our scool.
The code of the game is a mess, we only learned the basics so there are only the standard processing functions like `void draw()` and `void setup()`
I am now a better programmer! *(really!)* One day I will remake the game and write a cleaner code.
The name of the game is "Farben Fänger" *(or Farben Feanger cus ä)* which is German for "Colour Catcher"
You are a rectangle and need to cath falling balls in different colours like, red, blue, yellow, green and purple. You must have the same colour as the balls to collect them. You can change your colour with W, A, S, D. W = Red, A = Yellow, S = Green, D = Blue, you can catch purple balls with any colour.
There is also a black & White mode, if you hit -> on the title screen you can play it. All balls are white in this mode, so you don't have to change the colour.
